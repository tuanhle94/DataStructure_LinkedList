# DataStructure_LinkedList
Data Structure - Implementation of a singly linked list  in C#
# Description: 
1) Creates a class instance to represent a node. The node should have two properties, 'data' and 'next'. Accept both of these as arguments to the 'Node' constructor, then assign them to the instance as properties 'data' and 'next'. If 'next' is not provided to the constructor, then default its value to be 'null'.
2) Create a class to represent a linked list. When created, a linked list should have *no* head node associated with it. The LinkedList instance will have one property, 'head', which is a reference to the first node of the linked list. By default 'head' should be 'null'.
3) Implement LinkedList method such as InsertFirst, Size, GetFirst, GetLast, RemoveFirst, RemoveLast, InsertLast, GetAt, RemoveAt, InsertAt.
